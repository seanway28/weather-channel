# A 3rd Party API Challenge

Weather-Channel

The Task at hand:

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The OpenWeather One Call API was used to retrieve weather data for selected cities. A read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions was reviewed and sued to build the challenge.  I used localStorage was used throughout.
